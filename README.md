# SVG Motion Lab Playground

Minimal single-page React + Vite app for importing and manipulating SVGs.

Features:
- Import SVG via file or paste
- Select elements by clicking
- Edit `fill`, `stroke`, and `transform` attributes
- Delete elements
- Undo/Redo history (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)
- Save (download) edited SVG

To run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is an MVP focused on UI/UX, code clarity, and core editing flows. Improvements to add next: animated transforms, multiple-selection, path editing, layer panel, copy/paste, and better sanitization.
